Ansible Vault:

Most of the times when sensitive or confidential data need to be protected in the playbook, 
then it can be encrypted rather than just keeping it in a text file which is readable by all. 
Ansible Vault allows you to encrypt the playbook to protect the confidential data. 
 

$ansible-vault create jobagreement.yml     --->set passwd for jobagreement.yml

---
- hosts: servers
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: Copying Confidential Job Agreement
    copy: content="This is a Confidential Job Agreement" dest=/opt/jobagreement.txt

   you get error: ERROR! Unexpected Exception, this is probably a bug: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 
 to solve that error /.ansible/tmp give full permissions  --> $sudo chmod 777 tmp


$cat jobagreement.yml         --->it shows encrypted file not visible exact data

$ansible-vault encrypt existingfile.yml     ---->to encrypt alredy existing file


$ ansible-vault view jobagreement.yml         ----> view file

$ ansible-vault edit users.yml               ----> edit file

$ ansible-vault rekey jobagreement.yml        --->for changing passwrd

$ ansible-playbook users.yml --ask-vault-pass      ---> run playbook that is encrypted

$ ansible-vault decrypt jobagreement.yml               --->decrypt the file manually
